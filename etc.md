### Children
We havenâ€™t specifically included your children on the invitation as we thought you might like a day off.  However, they are very welcome.  Please let us know if you are bringing your children, so that we can cater for them.

### Gifts
The most important thing for us is that you can be there to celebrate our special day.  We are not expecting any presents.  If you would like to buy us something please choose a book; either one of your own favourites or something that you think we would enjoy.

### Weather
Hopefully reception drinks will be held amongst the Abbey Ruins.  This area is grassed so you might like to bring some flat shoes, or wellies if it's been very wet.
